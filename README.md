# Hotel-Booking-Prediction-Project

#### By **Ted Askoye Samuel**

## Description
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? Well, certain hotels wants to explore ways of improving on service delivery in an attempt to increase revenue collection. The task at hand is to find out what are the key metrics that will help improve service delivery in an attempt to increase revenue collection for the hotels and advice them. The aim of the project is to create a prediction repeat customer model against results already known, using it as a benchmark for forecasting.

## Experimental Design

Here is the breakdown of the process to implement this solution:
* Business Understanding: This sheds light to the context of the business question that we are trying to answer hence keep the focus during the data analysis so that we meet the intended objective.
* Reading the data: Reading our data with and aim to understand the variables and observations.
* Checking our data: This to get details about the dataset, the number of records, the statistal summary,the datatypes in our dataset among others.
* Data cleaning, will perform all data cleaning and preparation to make the data ready for analysis.
* EDA, the data will be analysed and visualized.
* Implementing the solution using univariate and bivariate analaysis
* Carry Out a Hypothesis Testing
* Report on hypothesis Testing Results
* Conclusion
